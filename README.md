## What is this?

A collection of powerful single-file agents built on top of [uv](https://github.com/astral/uv) - the modern Python package installer and resolver. 

These agents aim to do one thing and one thing only. They demonstrate precise prompt engineering and GenAI patterns for practical tasks many of which I share on the [IndyDevDan YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@indydevdan). Watch us walk through the Single File Agent in [this video](https://youtu.be/YAIJV48QlXc).

You can also check out [this video](https://youtu.be/vq-vTsbSSZ0) where we use [Devin](https://devin.ai/), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Aider](https://aider.chat/), and [PAIC-Patterns](https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding) to build three new agents with powerful spec (plan) prompts.

This repo contains a few agents built across the big 3 GenAI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic).

    --purpose "generate mermaid diagrams" \
    --instructions "generate a mermaid valid chart, use diagram type specified or default flow, use examples to understand the structure of the output" \
    --sections "user-prompt" \
    --variables "user-prompt"
```

### Bash Editor Agent (Anthropic)
> (sfa_bash_editor_agent_anthropic_v2.py)

An AI-powered assistant that can both edit files and execute bash commands using Claude's tool use capabilities.

Example usage:
```bash
# View a file
uv run sfa_bash_editor_agent_anthropic_v2.py --prompt "Show me the first 10 lines of README.md"

# Create a new file
uv run sfa_bash_editor_agent_anthropic_v2.py --prompt "Create a new file called hello.txt with 'Hello World!' in it"

# Replace text in a file
uv run sfa_bash_editor_agent_anthropic_v2.py --prompt "Create a new file called hello.txt with 'Hello World!' in it. Then update hello.txt to say 'Hello AI Coding World'"

# Execute a bash command
uv run sfa_bash_editor_agent_anthropic_v2.py --prompt "List all Python files in the current directory sorted by size"
```

### Polars CSV Agent (OpenAI)
> (sfa_polars_csv_agent_openai_v2.py)

An AI-powered assistant that generates and executes Polars data transformations for CSV files using OpenAI's function calling capabilities.

Example usage:
```bash
# Run Polars CSV agent with default compute loops (10)
uv run sfa_polars_csv_agent_openai_v2.py -i "data/analytics.csv" -p "What is the average age of the users?"

# Run with custom compute loops
uv run sfa_polars_csv_agent_openai_v2.py -i "data/analytics.csv" -p "What is the average age of the users?" -c 5
```

### Web Scraper Agent (OpenAI)
> (sfa_scrapper_agent_openai_v2.py)

An AI-powered web scraping and content filtering assistant that uses OpenAI's function calling capabilities and the Firecrawl API for efficient web scraping.

Example usage:
```bash
# Basic scraping with markdown list output
uv run sfa_scrapper_agent_openai_v2.py -u "https://example.com" -p "Scrap and format each sentence as a separate line in a markdown list" -o "example.md"

# Advanced scraping with specific content extraction
uv run sfa_scrapper_agent_openai_v2.py \
    --url https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding \
    --prompt "What are the names and descriptions of each lesson?" \
    --output-file-path paic-lessons.md \
    -c 10
```

## Features

- **Self-contained**: Each agent is a single file with embedded dependencies
- **Minimal, Precise Agents**: Carefully crafted prompts for small agents that can do one thing really well
- **Modern Python**: Built on uv for fast, reliable dependency management
- **Run From The Cloud**: With uv, you can run these scripts from your server or right from a gist (see my gists commands)
- **Patternful**: Building effective agents is about setting up the right prompts, tools, and process for your use case. Once you setup a great pattern, you can re-use it over and over. That's part of the magic of these SFA's. 

## Test Data

The project includes a test duckdb database (`data/analytics.db`), a sqlite database (`data/analytics.sqlite`), and a JSON file (`data/analytics.json`) for testing purposes. The database contains sample user data with the following characteristics:

### User Table
- 30 sample users with varied attributes
- Fields: id (UUID), name, age, city, score, is_active, status, created_at
- Test data includes:
  - Names: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eric, Fiona, Jane, John
  - Cities: Berlin, London, New York, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto
  - Status values: active, inactive, pending, archived
  - Age range: 20-65
  - Score range: 3.1-96.18
  - Date range: 2023-2025

Perfect for testing filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations with realistic data variations.

## Agents
> Note: We're using the term 'agent' loosely for some of these SFA's. We have prompts, prompt chains, and a couple are official Agents.

### JQ Command Agent 
> (sfa_jq_gemini_v1.py)

An AI-powered assistant that generates precise jq commands for JSON processing

Example usage:
```bash
# Generate and execute a jq command
uv run sfa_jq_gemini_v1.py --exe "Filter scores above 80 from data/analytics.json and save to high_scores.json"

# Generate command only
uv run sfa_jq_gemini_v1.py "Filter scores above 80 from data/analytics.json and save to high_scores.json"
```

### DuckDB Agents
